# DBMS Lab 1 Assignment

## Description
This repository contains the SQL solutions for Lab 1, covering DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations. The code is written for an Oracle Database environment.

## File Structure
- `LAB_ASSIGNMENT1(Q).pdf`: The original assignment questions.
- `"LAB_ASSIGNMENT1.sql"`: The SQL script containing all queries for Part A and Part B.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project structure.

## How to Execute
1. Open Oracle SQL Developer.
2. Open the `"LAB_ASSIGNMENT1.sql"` file.
3. Select the queries individually or run the entire script using the "Run Script" (F5) button.

## Assumptions
- The `Phone` column was renamed to `MobileNo` before inserting data, so the INSERT statements use the new schema structure.
